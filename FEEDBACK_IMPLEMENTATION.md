# Onsite Request Feedback System

## Overview
The feedback system allows clients to provide optional feedback after completing their onsite document requests. This helps improve service quality and provides valuable insights to the registrar staff.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **New Table**: `feedbacks`
  - `id`: Primary key
  - `onsite_request_id`: Foreign key to onsite_requests table
  - `rating`: Integer (1-5) star rating
  - `comment`: Optional text feedback (max 1000 characters)
  - `full_name`: Name of the person providing feedback
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

### 2. Model Relationships
- `OnsiteRequest` has one `Feedback`
- `Feedback` belongs to `OnsiteRequest`

### 3. Controllers & Routes
- **FeedbackController**:
  - `show()`: Display feedback form for completed requests
  - `store()`: Save feedback data with validation
- **New Routes**:
  - `GET /onsite-request/{id}/feedback` - Show feedback form
  - `POST /onsite-request/{id}/feedback` - Store feedback

### 4. User Interface Enhancements

#### Timeline Completion View
- Enhanced completion message with feedback option
- Extended redirect timer (10 seconds instead of 3)
- Skip redirect option for users who want to stay
- Conditional display based on feedback status

#### Feedback Form
- Interactive star rating system (1-5 stars)
- Optional comment textarea (1000 char limit)
- Responsive design matching NU branding
- Form validation and error handling

#### Registrar Dashboard
- Feedback display in completed requests table
- Star rating visualization
- Comment previews with tooltips
- "No feedback yet" indicator for requests without feedback

### 5. Business Logic
- Only completed requests can receive feedback
- One feedback per request (prevents duplicates)
- Feedback is optional and non-intrusive
- Automatic redirect can be skipped

## Files Modified/Created

## Usage Flow

1. **Client completes onsite request**: Request status becomes "completed"
2. **Completion page displays**: Shows success message with optional feedback button
3. **Client can choose**: Provide feedback or skip (auto-redirect after 10 seconds)
4. **Feedback submission**: Client rates service (1-5 stars) and optionally adds comments
5. **Confirmation**: Success message confirms feedback submission
6. **Registrar view**: Staff can see feedback ratings and comments in their dashboard

## Technical Notes

- Database migration needs to be run: `php artisan migrate`
- Feedback is stored with the requester's name for identification
- Star ratings use emoji stars for visual appeal
- Comments are truncated in list views but full text shown in tooltips
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop devices
