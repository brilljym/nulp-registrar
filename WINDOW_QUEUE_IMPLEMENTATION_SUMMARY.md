# Window-Based Queue Management System Implementation

## Summary
This implementation creates a queue management system where registrars can only see and handle requests assigned to their specific windows. When a window is occupied with a request, the registrar cannot receive new requests until the current one is completed.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Registrar Window Filtering**
- Registrars only see requests assigned to their window
- Current window status (occupied/available) is displayed
- Window occupancy prevents new request assignments

### 2. **Enhanced RegistrarOnsiteController**
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/RegistrarOnsiteController.php`

**Key Changes:**
- `index()` method now filters requests by registrar's window
- Added window occupancy checking logic
- Shows personalized messages based on window status
- Only displays relevant requests for each registrar

**New Methods Added:**
- `takeRequest()` - Allows registrar to take control of a request
- `completeRequest()` - Completes request and frees up window
- Enhanced `approveRequest()` - Checks window availability before approval

### 3. **Updated View (index.blade.php)**
**File:** `resources/views/registrar/onsite/index.blade.php`

**Key Changes:**
- Added window status alert at the top
- Personalized headers showing registrar's window number
- Improved action buttons with window occupancy logic
- Better empty state messages

### 4. **Enhanced QueueService**
**File:** `app/Services/QueueService.php`

**Key Changes:**
- `assignRegistrarToRequest()` - Now respects window availability
- `processNextRequestForWindow()` - Processes next request when window becomes free
- Better window occupancy management

### 5. **New Routes Added**
**File:** `routes/web.php`
```php
Route::post('/onsite/take/{onsiteRequest}', [RegistrarOnsiteController::class, 'takeRequest'])->name('onsite.take');
Route::post('/onsite/complete-request/{onsiteRequest}', [RegistrarOnsiteController::class, 'completeRequest'])->name('onsite.complete-request');
```

## How It Works

### Request Flow:
1. **Pending Requests**: Only shown to available registrars
2. **Window Assignment**: When registrar approves, request is assigned to their window
3. **Window Occupancy**: Window becomes occupied, blocking new requests
4. **Processing**: Only the assigned registrar can process the request
5. **Completion**: When completed, window becomes available for new requests

### Window States:
- **ðŸŸ¢ AVAILABLE**: Window is free to receive new requests
- **ðŸ”´ OCCUPIED**: Window is processing a request, cannot receive new ones

### Registrar View Logic:
```php
// Show window status
if ($isWindowOccupied && $currentRequest) {
    // Only show current request being handled
    $query->where('id', $currentRequest->id);
} else {
    // Show available requests based on route
    // Filter by window assignment and availability
}
```

## Database Requirements

### Tables Used:
- `windows` - Window management (already exists)
- `registrars` - Registrar-window assignments (already exists)
- `onsite_requests` - Request tracking with window_id and assigned_registrar_id

### Key Relationships:
- `OnsiteRequest` belongsTo `Window`
- `OnsiteRequest` belongsTo `User` (registrar)
- `Registrar` belongsTo `User`

## User Experience Improvements

### For Registrars:
- Clear visibility of their window status
- Only see relevant requests for their window
- Cannot accidentally take requests when window is occupied
- Automatic window management

### Visual Indicators:
- Window status alerts
- Personalized headers with window numbers
- Context-aware action buttons
- Clear empty state messages

## Testing

### Test Script Created:
**File:** `test_window_queue.php`
- Shows window occupancy status
- Lists registrar-window assignments
- Displays current request assignments

### Current System Status:
- 6 windows available (Window 1-6)
- Multiple registrars assigned to windows
- Window occupancy properly tracked

## Files Modified/Created:

### Controllers:
- `app/Http/Controllers/RegistrarOnsiteController.php` âœ… Enhanced
- `app/Services/QueueService.php` âœ… Enhanced

### Views:
- `resources/views/registrar/onsite/index.blade.php` âœ… Enhanced

### Routes:
- `routes/web.php` âœ… New routes added

### Testing:
- `test_window_queue.php` âœ… Created for verification

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements):

1. **Real-time Updates**: Add Pusher notifications for window status changes
2. **Window Transfer**: Allow requests to be transferred between windows
3. **Queue Prioritization**: Implement priority levels for urgent requests
4. **Analytics**: Track window utilization and performance metrics
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize for mobile devices

## Conclusion

The window-based queue management system is now fully implemented. Each registrar can only see and handle requests for their assigned window, and the system prevents conflicts by managing window occupancy automatically. The implementation maintains data integrity while providing a clear, user-friendly interface for registrars.
